No-code for developers
========

Today there is a lot of buzz about no-code and low-code development. Typically, the talk is about non-developers or “citizen developers” using no-code / low-code approaches, but it can also be an option for developers.

In the movie Spinal Tap, Nigel Tufnel explains to Marty DiBergi (the film maker) that he has modified his amplifiers so the all the volume knobs go up to eleven, rather than ten.

Marty: “Does that mean it’s louder? Is it any louder?”

Nigel: “Well, it’s one louder, isn’t it? It’s not ten. You see, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten…Where can you go from there? Where?”

Marty: “Why don’t you make ten a little louder? Make that the top number and make that a little louder?”

Nigel: “These go to eleven.”

Developers are constantly being asked to do more and do it faster. Develop new business-critical apps. Deploy code more quickly. Deploy less buggy code. Keep up with technology. Step into quasi-support roles. Train new developers. Keep up with the latest streaming episodes on your favorite TV show. The demands can be mind-boggling.

There are many options to address these needs. Agile processes, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). DevOps. Following blogs about your favorite streaming shows.

Today there is a lot of buzz about no-code and low-code development. Typically, the talk is about non-developers or “citizen developers” using no-code / low-code approaches, but it can also be an option for developers.

However, like Nigel, developers tend to want to do things themselves. They don’t like out-of-the-box solutions when they know they can build something better.

But maybe no-code for developers is not such a bad thing. After all, in the hands of a rock-star developer, maybe that app can be cranked to eleven, and we could all be rock gods like Spinal Tap.
